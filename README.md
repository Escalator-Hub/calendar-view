# Calendar View
iCalendar rendering view that allows for filtering of calendars and extensible semantic data such as geolocation and traveling time.

## The Escalator Challenge
Escalator are asking that this repository be forked as part of a community challenge to allow developers to build their own responsive web-based calendar views that can be used interchangeably across projects. The project has been set-up with a Node.js toolchain and the end result should be a semantic XHTML5 responsive calendar view with support for the [iCalendar standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar).
